ekf_filter_node:
    ros__parameters:
# The frequency, in Hz, at which the filter will output a position estimate. Note that the filter will not begin
# computation until it receives at least one message from one of the inputs. It will then run continuously at the
# frequency specified here, regardless of whether it receives more measurements. Defaults to 30 if unspecified.
        frequency: 100.0

# The period, in seconds, after which we consider a sensor to have timed out. In this event, we carry out a predict
# cycle on the EKF without correcting it. This parameter can be thought of as the minimum frequency with which the
# filter will generate new output. Defaults to 1 / frequency if not specified.

        #sensor_timeout: 0.1

# ekf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node both use a 3D omnidirectional motion model. If this parameter is
# set to true, no 3D information will be used in your state estimate. Use this if you are operating in a planar
# environment and want to ignore the effect of small variations in the ground plane that might otherwise be detected
# by, for example, an IMU. Defaults to false if unspecified.
        two_d_mode: true

# Use this parameter to provide an offset to the transform generated by ekf_localization_node. This can be used for
# future dating the transform, which is required for interaction with some other packages. Defaults to 0.0 if
# unspecified.
        transform_time_offset: 0.0

# Use this parameter to provide specify how long the tf listener should wait for a transform to become available. 
# Defaults to 0.0 if unspecified.
        transform_timeout: 0.0

# If you're having trouble, try setting this to true, and then echo the /diagnostics_agg topic to see if the node is
# unhappy with any settings or data.
        print_diagnostics: true

# Debug settings. Not for the faint of heart. Outputs a ludicrous amount of information to the file specified by
# debug_out_file. I hope you like matrices! Please note that setting this to true will have strongly deleterious
# effects on the performance of the node. Defaults to false if unspecified.
        debug: false

# Defaults to "robot_localization_debug.txt" if unspecified. Please specify the full path.
        debug_out_file: /path/to/debug/file.txt

# Whether we'll allow old measurements to cause a re-publication of the updated state
        permit_corrected_publication: false

# Whether to publish the acceleration state. Defaults to false if unspecified.
        publish_acceleration: false

# Whether to broadcast the transformation over the /tf topic. Defaults to true if unspecified.
        publish_tf: true

        map_frame: map              # Defaults to "map" if unspecified
        odom_frame: odom            # Defaults to "odom" if unspecified
        base_link_frame: base_footprint  # Defaults to "base_link" if unspecified
        world_frame: odom           # Defaults to the value of odom_frame if unspecified

# Each sensor reading updates some or all of the filter's state. These options give you greater control over which
# values from each measurement are fed to the filter. For example, if you have an odometry message as input, but only
# want to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry. The order of the
# values is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some message types
# do not provide some of the state variables estimated by the filter. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message
# has no pose information, so the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false
# if unspecified, effectively making this parameter required for each sensor.

# If you have high-frequency data or are running with a low frequency parameter value, then you may want to increase
# the size of the subscription queue so that more measurements are fused.
        
        #odom0_queue_size: 2

# [ADVANCED] Large messages in ROS can exhibit strange behavior when they arrive at a high frequency. This is a result
# of Nagle's algorithm. This option tells the ROS subscriber to use the tcpNoDelay option, which disables Nagle's
# algorithm.
        odom0_nodelay: false

# [ADVANCED] When measuring one pose variable with two sensors, a situation can arise in which both sensors under-
# report their covariances. This can lead to the filter rapidly jumping back and forth between each measurement as they
# arrive. In these cases, it often makes sense to (a) correct the measurement covariances, or (b) if velocity is also
# measured by one of the sensors, let one sensor measure pose, and the other velocity. However, doing (a) or (b) isn't
# always feasible, and so we expose the differential parameter. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose
# data is converted to velocity data by differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then
# integrated as usual. NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide pose measurements; setting differential to true
# for twist measurements has no effect.
        odom0_differential: false

# [ADVANCED] When the node starts, if this parameter is true, then the first measurement is treated as a "zero point"
# for all future measurements. While you can achieve the same effect with the differential paremeter, the key
# difference is that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before
# integrating it. If you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true.
        odom0_relative: false

# [ADVANCED] If your data is subject to outliers, use these threshold settings, expressed as Mahalanobis distances, to
# control how far away from the current vehicle state a sensor measurement is permitted to be. Each defaults to
# numeric_limits<double>::max() if unspecified. It is strongly recommended that these parameters be removed if not
# required. Data is specified at the level of pose and twist variables, rather than for each variable in isolation.
# For messages that have both pose and twist data, the parameter specifies to which part of the message we are applying
# the thresholds.
